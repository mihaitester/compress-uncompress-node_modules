# Readme

I have been enocuntering this issue multiple times when storing code, and the problem is that I want to move source code containing Javascript to long term storage, also preserving the `node_modules` as it was at the present time. So the idea is to have a script which can zip and then unzip `node_modules` folder in subfolders of a given path.
